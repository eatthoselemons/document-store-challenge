there was the issue with the settings, I missunderstood that there was already a settings.py file so I went through the whole process of creating one

got stuck when I changed the database schema, I restarted the app and deleted the database but didn't know that there was the migration folder that needed to be removed as well. was stuck on that for a while thinking it was my schema and not the old schema persisting
